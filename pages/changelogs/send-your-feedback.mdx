Last week, we found ourselves in the aftermath of our exciting 3.0 launch. It was time to onboard new users, address any bugs reported during launch week, and have some great conversations with many of you.

Having spent a year building June 3.0, we needed to regroup and plan our next steps. Our designer, Daniel, took the lead on this. With a wealth of user research experience from his time at CircleCI, he crafted our interview scripts and began chatting with users.

## Sharing Our Learnings: User Interview Questions

As we explore what we’ll do next to double down on B2B metrics and how we’ll make June more flexible. Here are some questions we asked our users to better understand their needs:

## Intro questions

1. What are you using June for today? And what's the most valuable thing June does for you today?
2. Could you tell me what made you decide to start using June? Did something happen in your company or team that inspired the decision?

## Primary questions

1. What other analytics tools do you use along with June? Could you tell me when you use June versus the other?
2. What’s the biggest limit in June that restricts you from using it as your only analytics tool?
3. Similar question, what’s the biggest limit that holds back the rest of your team from using June?
4. Could you tell me a time when you used the information in one of your other analytics tools or June to take action or make a decision on something?
5. Is there anything else you’d expect to get out of June?

## Other tips on how to conduct user interviews

1. Have a note-taking partner or use AI transcription
2. Prepare a list of questions in advance
3. Involve your entire team in the interviews (e.g., have engineers speak with customers).
4. Keep an open mind and just listen. Don't try to validate your own ideas or bring them up.
5. Don't stick to the script — encourage follow-up questions and let the conversation flow.

If you have any feedback - even unrelated to these questions - just use the new feedback button in the bottom left corner of every page of the product.
